### Research Interest
Just as wings do not suddenly grow from a human's back, biological evolution does not possess unlimited possibilities. 
I am particularly interested in understanding the constraints and rules that guide biological evolution, and how these conditions have shaped the evolution of species in the past and may influence their future evolution. 
I am currently using a combination of machine learning, simulation, and evolutionary and population genetic analysis to address this question.
